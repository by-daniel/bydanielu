                currently developing and designing a website to encapsulate ‚ò∞ my works, ‚úé·ù∞ my words, and ·®í ‡Ωº  my world.

                for all of 2025, i am studying abroad for the whole year in pursuit of painting myself a more colourful life: even more paints of inspiration, observing cultural and societal differences/similarities with my own eyes, resonating with the stories from those who i am honored to meet for the places i visit.  
            </p>

            <p class="raleway-normal">
                during this time abroad, i  aim to rekindle a sense of strong passion, fulfilling purpose, and meaningful craftsmanship i once possessed. during winter and spring, i am studying abroad at tsinghua university (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶) in beijing, china under their school of law (Ê≥ïÂ≠¶Èô¢). as for summer and fall, i will be attending elisava school of design and engineering in barcelona, spain, specializing in a design focused programme. i will be returning to uc san diego in winter 2026.
            </p>
